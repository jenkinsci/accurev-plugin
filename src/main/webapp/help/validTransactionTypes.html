    <strong>WARNING:</strong> By changing the valid types of transactions you can miss 
    vital changes made to your source code.<br />
    <p>
        By default, the AccuRev plugin will allow any type of transaction to trigger a build.<BR><BR>
        This behavior is not always wanted, resulting in issue-triggered builds.<BR>
        <br />
        To solve this you specify the types of transactions that you want to use.<br />
        You enter the transaction types separated by commas like this:<br /><br />
        <code>add,chstream,co,defcomp,defunct,keep,mkstream,move,promote,purge,dispatch</code><br /><br />
    	The available transaction types are:
    	<ul>
            <li>add - </li>
            <li>chstream -</li>
            <li>co - </li>
            <li>defcomp - </li>
            <li>defunct - </li>
            <li>dispatch - </li>
            <li>keep - </li>
            <li>mkstream - </li>
            <li>move - </li>
            <li>promote - </li>
            <li>purge - </li>
            <li>dispatch - </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Note that if you are only ever building the contents of streams, then
        polling for "promote" transactions is likely to suffice on its own.

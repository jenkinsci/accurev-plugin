    	If checked then, before issuing an "accurev login" command, the plugin will
    	first issue an "accurev info" command to see if it is already logged in
    	and then only issue the "accurev login" command if it is not already logged
    	in as the desired user.
    	If not checked, an "accurev login" command will be issued before each attempt
    	to poll for changes and at the start of each build.
    	<br /><br />
    	This was introduced to work around the accurev client bug whereby a
    	login will first log out all active logins on that host before logging
    	in again, causing any other accurev commands running in other processes
    	to fail due to the client (temporarily) not being logged in.
    	For best effect, combine with the "-n" flag to ensure that, once logged in,
    	the client stays logged in permanently.

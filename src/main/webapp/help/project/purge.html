    <p>
        option allows you to specify whether or not a failed build will result in the next subsequent build purging and
        re-populating
        the workspace. this used to be the default behavior however in some instances it is not wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Disabling this option may result in subsequent builds continuing to fail where they would normally have
        succeeded after a purge/populate.

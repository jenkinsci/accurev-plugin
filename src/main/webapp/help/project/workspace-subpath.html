  <p>
    Some projects only use a portion of the workspace and, in such cases, it is not necessary to check out the
    entire workspace. For example, when accessing a large remote
    repository to build a sub-module.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you specify a sub-path, the plugin makes a "best effort" to ensure that only the sub-path is populated. This
    means that the files within the sub-path will be fetched, at
    least, but side-effects may result in files from other paths being fetched as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that the changelog does not filter by sub-path. Thus, any change in the repository will trigger a build.
  </p>

  <p>
    When using a workspace, you must update the workspace which populates any changed files and not just the files
    in the sub-path. The subsequent populate ensures that all the
    files in the sub-path are fetched, at least.

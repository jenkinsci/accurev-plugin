        Some projects only use a portion of the stream or reference tree and, in these instances, it is not necessary to
        check out the entire contents of the repository, such as
        when you are accessing, for example, a large remote repository to build a sub-module. In such cases, it may be
        useful to set up a sub-path. If you specify a sub-path, the
        plugin makes a "best effort" to ensure that only the sub-path is populated. This means that the files within the
        sub-path will be fetched, at least, although side-effects
        may result in files from other locations being fetched as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        Directories and files must be specified in a comma-separated list and can use relative pathnames. For example,
        you could use:
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>src/com/my-company/main/my-file.java,src/com/test,src/com/webapp/my-file2.xml</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        where "src" is the immediate sub-folder under your stream or reference tree.
    </p>

        NOTES:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>Sub-path</b> option only works if you configure it before the first build is triggered.</li>
        <li>If you specify a sub-path and you also select <b>Poll SCM</b> in the <b>Build Triggers</b> section of the
            Jenkins configuration page, but you do not specify any <b>Filter
                for Poll SCM</b> files or directories, then the sub-path files and directories are used as the filter
            for polling. In this case, changes made to elements in the
            sub-path will trigger a build in Jenkins.
        </li>

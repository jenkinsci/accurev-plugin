  <p>
    If the <b>Poll SCM</b> check box under the <b>Build Triggers</b> section is selected, you can use the <b>Filter
    for Poll SCM</b> field to specify the directories or files
    you want Jenkins to check before starting a build. Any changes made to the files or directories that you specify
    in the <b>Filter for Poll SCM</b> field will trigger a
    build in Jenkins.
  </p>

  <p>
    Directories and files must be specified in a comma-separated list and can use relative pathnames. For example,
    you could use:
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>src/com/my-company/main/my-file.java,src/com/test,src/com/webapp/my-file2.xml,src/com/*</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    where "src" is the immediate sub-folder under your stream or reference tree.

  </p>

  <p>NOTE: If you select <b>Poll SCM</b> in the <b>Build Triggers</b> section of the Jenkins configuration page, but
    you do not specify any <b>Filter for Poll SCM</b> files or
    directories, then any files or directories you have specified in the <b>Sub-path</b> field are used as the
    filter for polling. In this case, changes made to elements in the
    sub-path will trigger a build in Jenkins.
  </p>

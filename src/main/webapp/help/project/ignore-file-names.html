		If checked then:<br/>

		All polling will have its file results filtered through these regular expressions. (Standard java regex impl syntax)<br/>
		Any file change found to be matching any of the regexes will be ignored and will not contribute to possibly triggering a build.<br/>
		NOTE: this setting changes the behavior of polling from only pulling a single transaction to pulling the latest, which is a heavier call on both the Accurev server and the runtime of the polling.

		All polling will have its file results filtered through these regular expressions. (Standard java regex syntax)<br/>
		Example syntax:  .*\.java    to match all .java extension files, note the single escape on the .<br/>
		Example syntax:  .*/scripts/.*    to match anything inside a dir named scripts<br/>
		Any file change found to be matching any of the regexes will be IGNORED and will not contribute to possibly triggering a build.<br/>
		File paths returned by accurev typically resemble: "foo/bar/Baz.java", note the use of unix-style file seperators.</br>
		NOTE: this setting changes the behavior of polling from only polling a single transaction and testing transaction # high watermarks to polling the latest and testing all of the retrieved files, which is a heavier call on both the Accurev server and the runtime of the polling.

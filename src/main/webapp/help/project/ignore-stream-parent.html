		If checked then, when checking for changes etc, the plugin will ignore
		the possibility that there have been changes in the parent stream that
		affect the contents of the stream being polled.

		This is purely a runtime optimisation for when accurev is being used
		as a normal VCS and not taking advantage of its stream inheritance.

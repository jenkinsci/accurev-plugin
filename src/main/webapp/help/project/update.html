    <p>
        By default, this plugin purges the workspace for every build. There are a number of operations
        which when performed in Accurev, can make it impossible for a client to successfully complete
        an <code>accurev update</code> operation with the workspace populated. The sequence of purge,
        update, populate has not failed. The down side is that it is slower.
    </p>
    <p>
        Selecting this option will enable the plugin to skip the purge step and just use update
        (followed by a populate just in case any files went missing). <strong>NOTE: however, in order to
        allow Jenkins to recover from the "cannot complete update" situation a purge will always
        be performed if the last build failed.</strong>

        By default, AccuRev Plug-in for Jenkins checks out the latest changes without using a reference tree. When not
        using a reference tree, AccuRev Plug-in for Jenkins uses the
        <code>accurev pop -R</code> command to extract all the files. However, there may be situations when the use of a
        reference tree is preferred, such as when you want to use
        the latest versions of files that you do not intend to modify. You can think of a reference tree as a read-only
        portal to the AccuRev data repository.
    </p>

    <p>If the <b>Use Reference Tree</b> check box is marked, AccuRev Plug-in for Jenkins attempts to use the reference
        tree specified in the <b>Reference Tree</b> text box. (You
        must create a reference tree in AccuRev before you can specify it here.) AccuRev Plug-in for Jenkins manages the
        process of migrating the reference tree to the appropriate
        build machine and relocating the reference tree to use the correct location. Note that these changes are
        recorded in the AccuRrev repository.</p>
    <p>
        When using a reference tree, the following Accurev commands are used:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>accurev show refs</code> confirms that the reference tree is valid and has the correct parent stream.
        </li>
        <li><code>accurev chref</code> is run if the reference tree is in the wrong directory or on the wrong machine.
            <i>(Optional)</i>
        </li>
        <li><code>accurev update</code> refreshes the reference tree. If the update fails, AccuRev Plug-in for Jenkins
            uses the <code>accurev update -9</code> command to update the
            reference tree.
        </li>
        <li><code>accurev pop -O -R</code> ensures that all files are populated and that the reference tree always
            contains the fresh update.
        </li>
    </ul>

        If the <b>Create and build from snapshot</b> check box is marked, you can specify the naming conventions for the snapshot in this field. The format you specify configures
        the manner in which the snapshot is named and it allows the use of environment variables using the same syntax as Apache Ant uses for property expansion. For example, a
        literal <code>$</code> must be escaped by using <code>$$</code>, and <code>${</code><i>name</i><code>}</code> resolves to the value of environment variable "<i>name</i>".
    </p>

    <p>
        The <b>Snapshot Name Format</b> can be set to any combination of literal text and environment variables, subject to naming restrictions for AccuRev snapshots. Specifically,
        the snapshot name must begin with a non-digit other than dot (.), and must not include either a slash (/) or a backslash (\). For example, "<code>${ACCUREV_STREAM}_${BUILD_NUMBER}_Snapshot</code>"
        would take the name of the stream being built, append an underscore, append the build number and, finally, append "_Snapshot", which would result in a snapshot name of the
        form "MyStreamName_1234_Snapshot".
    </p>

    <p>
        If this option is not set, the snapshot name defaults to "<code>${JOB_NAME}_${BUILD_NUMBER}</code>".

  <p>
    By default, this plugin checks out the latest changes without using a workspace. This removes
    the need to
    manually create a workspace for each project, and removes the need for the plugin to make
    transactions
    while moving the workspace from slave to slave as the build migrates from slave to slave.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, there may be situations when the use of a workspace is preferred. If you want to use a
    workspace,
    select this option and enter the name of an existing workspace in the <b>Workspace</b> field.
    The plugin can
    manage
    migrating the workspace to the appropriate build machine and re-parenting the workspace to use
    the correct
    parent
    stream (Jenkins considers the <b>Stream</b> field value as the parent stream). Note that
    workspace changes
    (<code>accurev chws</code>) are logged as AccuRev transactions.
  </p>

  <p>When not using a workspace, the following AccuRev commands will be used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>accurev pop -O -R .</code> to extract all the files. Note: this command will not work
      if the
      directory that the files are being extracted to is the child of an active AccuRev workspace.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>When using a workspace, the following AccuRev commands are used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>accurev show wspaces</code> to validate that the workspace is valid and has the
      correct parent stream
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If the workspace needs to be relocated or if the host machine needs to be updated, the
    following AccuRev commands
    are also used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>accurev chws</code></li>
    <li><code>accurev update -9</code></li>
    <li><code>accurev pop -O -R .</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Otherwise, the following commands are run:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>accurev chws</code> (if re-parenting is required)</li>
    <li><code>accurev update</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Note: </b>If you decide to stop using an AccuRev workspace after having run a build, you
    must manually move
    the AccuRev workspace directory.</p>

  <p>If checked then:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The plugin will (only) run accurev polling operations
      on the master node.
    </li>
    <li>
      Builds will no longer be triggered just because the
      slave that did the last build goes offline.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If not checked then:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Polling operations will be run on the slave that did the last build.
    </li>
    <li>
      If that slave does offline, a new build will be triggered,
      whether or not there are changes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Do NOT enable this unless accurev is installed on the master node.</p>

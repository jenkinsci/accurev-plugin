				The plugin will (only) run accurev polling operations

				Builds will no longer be triggered just because the

		If not checked then:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Polling operations will be run on the slave that did the last build.

				If that slave does offline, a new build will be triggered,
				whether or not there are changes.

		Do NOT enable this unless accurev is installed on the master node.

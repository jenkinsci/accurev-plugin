        If checked, the plugin will add the '-n' flag to the 'accurev login'
        command when logging in.
        <br/><br/>
        This flag requests a login session that will <i>not</i> expire after
        an arbitrary time period has elapsed.
        This is rarely an issue when using "traditional" authentication, but
        can be useful when using "accurev_login" or "custom" authentication
        on the server as these default to making login sessions time out and
        expire after 240 minutes.

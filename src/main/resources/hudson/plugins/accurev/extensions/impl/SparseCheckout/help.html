  <p>
    Some projects only use a portion of the stream or reference tree and, in these instances, it is not necessary to
    check out the entire contents of the repository<br>
    In such cases, it may be useful to only populate what's specified in the sparse checkout.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Directories and files must be specified one per line and must use relative pathnames. For
    example,
    you could use:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>src/com/my-company/main/my-file.java<br>
      src/com/test<br>
      src/com/webapp/my-file2.xml</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    where "src" is the immediate sub-folder under your stream or reference tree.
  </p>
  <p>
    NOTES:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you specify a spare checkout, with <b>Poll SCM</b> selected, where you do not specify any <b>Inclusion or
      Exclusion</b> files or directories,
      <br>then the Sparse checkout files and directories are used as the filter for polling.<br>
      In this case, changes made to elements in the Sparse checkout will trigger a build in Jenkins.
    </li>
  </ul>
